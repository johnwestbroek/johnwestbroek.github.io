              <p>I was recently talking with a very busy friend about personal tooling. He&#39;s a freelancer that also manages several hobby projects. As a busy person, he tries to have a kind of system that speeds up his tasks and eases his work day. I&#39;m a bit the same, so we dug deeper into the subject, until I came to a realization.</p>
<p>Yes, we use tools to achieve the same goal, but we have very different relationships with them.</p>
<h2>Our personal systems</h2><p>This friend is a smart, very intellectual guy capable of self-reflection. He often changes the way his system works to try to achieve automations. But at some point, managing and self-reflecting on this system has become another task in itself that seems to add work to his already busy schedule.</p>
<p>Since he can&#39;t program, he has to tinker inside existing apps and follow this field evolution. Else, if another tool comes out and is doing exactly whan he needs, he could miss it! He uses things like the Shortcut app in iOs to automate tasks. He tracks his time, both for profesionnal and personal projects, through a service like Toggle. I don&#39;t know his whole setup but I&#39;m sure that if something is considered top notch, he&#39;s using it!</p>
<p>Now, let&#39;s compare to my own kinda yolo system. I have a single text file that serves as a journal, a wiki and a bookmarking tool. A program I made turns it into a website. I created my own time tracking system that uses another text file. My own markup language is used to write those text files, while my pattern library allows me to decorate things. I use a salvaged computer that runs a very specific linux distribution named Regolith, and use very few external services outside of Github and a chat programs.</p>
<p>So there&#39;s quite a difference between us. But what I feel is the biggest one is how, at first sight, my tools are very personal but unproductive. Meanwhile, my friend&#39;s tools seem super productive but very generic.</p>
